This is the Lithogen Plugins folder.

Plugins can be used to customise the build process, for example to write a new
view processor. To do so, implement an interface from Lithogen.Core.Interfaces
and drop your DLL in here.

Watch the beginning of the log to see if your plugin is being detected.
